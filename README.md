"Universal Webapps" --> faster loading of web sites!

> How? server does pre-rendering of the "start" HTML & CSS on server-side - and then loads JavaScript & dynamic CSS in the background, but user can already scroll and read.

All 3 popular web frameworks support Universal Web Apps:

* Angular: https://angular.io/guide/universal
* React: https://nextjs.org/ and https://www.gatsbyjs.com/
* Vue.js: https://nuxtjs.org/



## Nuxt.js

There are 3 modes: normal SPA (like Vue), Server Side Rendering (SSR) & Static Side Generation

* __SPA__: In this mode, Nuxt.js behaves just like a normal Vue.js application
* __[Server Side Rendering (SSR)](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/2.x/concepts/server-side-rendering)__: SSR sends fully rendered page from server to the client -> which then gets hydrated (https://ssr.vuejs.org/guide/hydration.html), which means that Vue.js turns the server rendered page into dynamic DOM that can react to client-side data changes
* __[Static Side Generation](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/2.x/concepts/static-site-generation)__: the application gets rendered during build phase and can then be deployed to any static hosting service (Netlify, GitHub Pages, AWS S3 static site hosting, Static hosting on Azure Storage Accounts etc.). There's no server needed for deployment & the content is delivered via Content Delivery Networks (CDNs). Additionally in Static Side Generation mode there's also [a SPA Fallback for sites that should be rendered on client side and won't be served through the CDN](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/2.x/concepts/static-site-generation#spa-fallback).
